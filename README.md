A. Project Overview

Brief Description of the Project:

This project involves developing an image classification model that can recognize and differentiate 20 related plant species using Google Teachable Machine. A dataset containing
at least 250 images per species was collected and organized into labeled classes. The model was trained, evaluated, and tested to measure its accuracy and performance in identifying plant 
species based on visual features.

Purpose of the Image Classification Model:

The purpose of this image classification model is to automatically identify plant species from images using machine learning techniques. It aims to demonstrate how computer vision
can be applied to classify plants accurately and how dataset quality, training parameters, and evaluation methods affect model performance.

Common Name: CACTUS    
Scientific Name: Cactaceae

Description:
Cacti are a family of succulent plants adapted to survive in dry and arid environments. They store water in their thick, fleshy stems and usually have spines instead of leaves to reduce water
loss and protect against herbivores. Cacti can vary widely in shape, size, and flower color, and they are commonly used for ornamental purposes, landscaping, and sometimes food or medicine.
